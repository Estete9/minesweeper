  <p>Write the class <code class="java">EspressoMachine</code> with the <code class="java">Float</code> property <code class="java">costPerServing</code>. Objects of the class can be created with two secondary constructors.</p> 
  <p>The first constructor takes arguments <code class="java">coffeeCapsulesCount</code> and <code class="java">totalCost</code>, which are of <code class="java">Int</code> and <code class="java">Float</code> type respectively. The value of the property <code class="java">costPerServing</code> is calculated as the cost of one coffee capsule.</p> 
  <p>The second constructor takes properties <code class="java">coffeeBeansWeight</code> and <code class="java">totalCost</code>, both of the type <code class="java">Float</code>. The value of the property <code class="java">costPerServing</code> is calculated a little differently. Consider that for each cup of coffee, the machine takes <code class="java">10.6</code> weight units of coffee beans. You need to calculate how many servings can be made of the given <code class="java">coffeeBeansWeight</code> and then calculate the cost of one serving using <code class="java">totalCost</code> of coffee beans.</p> 
  <p><strong>Hint: </strong>be extra careful with the division when calculating the cost of coffee serving made with beans.</p>
