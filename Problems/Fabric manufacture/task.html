  <p>Complete the secondary constructor of the given class <code class="java">Fabric</code>. The secondary constructor should take <code class="java">color</code>, <code class="java">pattern</code>, and <code class="java">patternColor</code> as arguments and change the corresponding property values. Then, updated information about the fabric should be printed.</p> 
  <p>The complete process of creating an object of the Fabric class should be as following: </p> 
  <ol> 
   <li>The fabric of the default grey color is created. </li> 
   <li>The fabric is dyed in some other color. </li> 
   <li>Some color pattern is applied to the fabric.</li> 
  </ol> 
  <p>Each step is accompanied by the output:</p> 
  <ol> 
   <li>"grey fabric is created" — for initial object creation, as shown in the primary constructor in the template;</li> 
   <li>"the fabric is dyed &lt;color&gt;" — for dying fabric in a different color, where &lt;color&gt; is the corresponding argument, provided to the secondary constructor;</li> 
   <li>"&lt;patternColor&gt; &lt;pattern&gt; pattern is printed on the fabric" — for applying a color pattern on the fabric, where &lt;pattern&gt; and &lt;patternColor&gt; are arguments, provided to the secondary constructor.</li> 
  </ol> 
  <p>For example, creating a new object <code class="java">val fabric = Fabric("white", "dots", "black")</code> is accompanied by the following output:</p> 
  <pre><code class="language-no-highlight">grey fabric is created
the fabric is dyed white
black dots pattern is printed on the fabric</code></pre>
