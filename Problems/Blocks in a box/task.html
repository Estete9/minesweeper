  <p>Let's create a simple class with a nested object. There is a box of children's blocks. All of them are the same size but can be different colors. We will store these objects in a class <code class="java">Block</code> with one property <code class="java">color</code> and a nested object <code class="java">DimProperties</code> with properties <span style="color: #000000;"><code class="java">length</code> </span>and <code class="java">width</code>. Your task is to create this structure!</p> 
  <p>In addition, your nested object should have a <code class="java">blocksInBox()</code> function that receives the length and width of a box and returns how many blocks this box can store.</p> 
  <p>Make the properties of a nested object mutable for the validation system! You may initialize them with any numbers. Don't worry about heights, solve it like a 2D problem. Don't rotate the blocks.</p>
